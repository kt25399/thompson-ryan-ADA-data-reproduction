Names of data files (.csv) correspond to specific figure panels within Akers et al., "Hippocampal neurogenesis regulates forgetting during adulthood and infancy", Science. Details of experimental timelines, treatment groups, behavioral procedures, drug doses, etc. are reported in the Supplementary Online Material on the Science website.
